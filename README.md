# Build your own Serverless Food Delivery App in 3 hours!

Goal: Leverage AWS Serverless services to build a simple food delivery app in less than 3 hours!

In this workshop, we will understand how easy & quick it is to build real-world applications using Serverless on AWS and understand the various
services that can be leveraged. The application will present users with a React user interface for ordering food items. The interface on the
backend with RESTful and WebSocket services will accept the request, and find and dispatch food to the requester’s location. The application will
also provide facilities for users to register with the service and log in before ordering food.
